CHECK IF BOTH HALVES OF THE STRING HAVE SOME
SET OF CHARACTERS IN PYTHON

given a string of lowercase characters only, the task
is to check if it is possible to split a string from middle
which will gives two halves having the same characters and same
frequency of each character. if length of the given string is ODD 
then ignore the middle element and check for the rest 

Examples:

Input : abbaab
Output : NO
The two halves contain the same characters
but their frequencies do not match so they
are NOT CORRECT

Input : abccab
Output : YES

1.Break string in two parts and convert both parts into dictionary 
using Counter(iterator) method, each dictionary contains itâ€™s 
character as key and frequency as value.

2.Now compare these two dictionaries. In python we can compare two 
using == operator, it first checks keys of both dictionaries are 
same or not, then it checks for values of each key. 
If everything is equal that means two dictionaries are identical.
